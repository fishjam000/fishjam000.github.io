Hello! I am majoring in Visual Communication Design, with a UX certificate! I am passionate about coming up with innovative design solutions. I love publishing and product design; designing print materials is my favorite! I also like to do UX/UI design as well as web design! I wish to explore more of the digital facets of design. I also love drawing! It’s been a lifelong passion of mine. My favorite mediums are traditional, but I can also do digital illustration! I am proficient at the Adobe Creative Suite, with Illustrator as my favorite program.

Currently, I am interning at the EWU Institute for Public Policy & Economic Analysis as well as at Sixth Avenue Pharmacy as their Visual Design intern. 

My goal is to incorporate sustainability in my designs as much as I can, whether it’s spreading awareness or being mindful of the materials used.
Being sustainable and eco-friendly is very important to me, and I am excited to be able to include them in design! I want to be able to use my own voice to create change. 
It’s also a goal of mine to be able to create designs and art that bring joy to people. I want to be able to work with all kinds of design mediums in my career.
I am passionate about designing, eating food, and telling bad puns. I am fueled by matcha green tea.
